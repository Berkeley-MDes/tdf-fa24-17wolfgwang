## Week of 10/24/2024

I attached it to the backpack and performed calibration using SensorLab, as Jeff recommended.

Everything is working well, and I’ve assembled it all together.  

The plan is to enclose the components in a box like this and attach it to the bag using a cable tie in the back.  
<img width="570" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 3 48 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e2f956-d7c4-478b-945e-a2c8745b1a48">  

After calibration, the correct posture will be set, and as the user moves, the device will trigger vibration and LED notifications when necessary.

## Week of 10/10/2024

We have formed a team for the project. The idea, developed together with Yule, is a posture correction notification system using a gyroscope sensor.

As shown in the image below, when the back is bent or posture is poor, the gyro sensor detects the angle and triggers a notification.

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 3 57 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242823bd-b355-456f-8012-0e2b3f0f6679">

The operation process is summarized as follows:

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 3 57 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752656ca-fd85-4566-b212-fd5ff339357c">

The essential inputs are:

- Input 1: Button 1 – Power on/off
- Input 2: Gyroscope sensor data
- Input 3: Button 2 – Calibration process on

The outputs will be : 
- Vibrator
- LED

I'm looking forward to seeing how the project will turn out.

## Week of 10/03/2024

I learned a new technology, Photon2.

I had briefly worked with Arduino before, but this was my first time using Photon2. The main difference is that it can connect to the internet, while the rest is pretty much the same as Arduino.

Since I learned how to make connections during the class, I wanted to try a small project using LEDs. I found a project in the class materials that changes the LED color based on pressure, so I decided to give it a try.

<img width="878" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 3 57 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78f00ff1-d959-4299-acb2-50765bfd744d">

I uploaded a video of it working on YouTube. Due to the unstable connection of the pressure sensor, I had to hold it by hand during the test.

Next time, I plan to use an API to take advantage of its internet connectivity.

## Week of 09/26/2024

This is my concept map of my Work & Productivity Ecosystems

<img width="1000" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 10 42 41 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15c728ae-58f2-48bb-8418-14215fcc4880">

I enjoy working. The experience of immersing myself in something and creating something from nothing is always enjoyable for me. However, I can’t dedicate all of my time to work since life involves many different aspects, including relationships. In order to perform well at work, considering productivity is essential. To live more productively, I’ve organized the concepts and tools I use into six key categories:

1. Physical Workspace

Creating a productive environment is crucial for focusing on tasks. I often use my AirPods to block out surrounding noise, which helps me concentrate no matter where I am. Additionally, when my focus starts to wane, drinking water helps me refresh and regain my concentration. At night, I use a desk light that illuminates only a small area, allowing me to focus solely on that spot. These elements help me create a physical environment that’s suited for productive work.

2. Digital Tools

I’m a big fan of Notion. I use it for recording schedules, journaling, and even taking notes. A few years ago, I used to write things by hand, but now Notion has become an indispensable tool. I also use AI tools like ChatGPT every day. It feels like having an extra assistant, helping me handle tasks more efficiently within limited time and resources, greatly boosting my productivity. Tools like Slack and Discord are also incredibly effective for team collaboration. They not only allow us to communicate but also to store and manage various resources.

3. Time Management

Time management is critical. To manage my time effectively, I use a physical timer called Time Timer Mod. I also prioritize my tasks and organize them in Notion, as mentioned earlier, while using Google Calendar to manage both my MDes schedule and personal events.

4. Professional Development

Professional growth doesn’t come just from doing the work. You need to constantly learn and develop yourself. I often use platforms like Coursera and YouTube to study more advanced or simplified versions of topics I’m learning. Additionally, I receive feedback and guidance through mentoring, which helps me evaluate my gaps and find the necessary resources. Participating in hackathons also gives me the opportunity to meet diverse people and gain inspiration.

5. Collaboration

In teamwork, the most important thing is minimizing communication loss. The less of that, the more efficient the work becomes. Figma plays a key role in bridging that gap, allowing us to work on the same thing while seeing and communicating the same ideas. When time and space constraints make team collaboration difficult, we use Zoom or Google Meet for remote meetings. Files are also shared in real-time through Google Drive, making them accessible from anywhere. This has been incredibly helpful for me.

6. Health & Wellness

Taking care of my health is just as important. I try to follow a routine and lead a more structured life every day. Although I don’t particularly enjoy vegetables, I make sure to eat at least one meal a day that includes them to maintain a balanced diet. I also drink water frequently, aiming for over 2 liters a day, which helps me feel more refreshed and energized.

This is my Work & Productivity Ecosystem. I hope to learn many interesting things from this class that will positively impact my work life!

## Week of 09/19/2024

This week, I had an assignment to create a video alongside 3D printing. While brainstorming ideas, I found myself unconsciously sketching something on my rattling tablet. I often thought it was something I really needed while drawing, and this project made me realize it was time to create it.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 10 13 01 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9befb78-adae-4de1-8056-9ae02ebc2c51">

Studying Rhino was quite challenging. I learned by clicking on each node, understanding its meaning, and making adjustments as I went along.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 09 44 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3082b9c2-3ddb-4116-9db9-981ae62fdd3d">

As I was following each node, wondering, "What makes this better compared to typical 3D modeling tools?", I realized something. I was logically thinking through how the design was constructed, step by step. While I’m not sure if this was the original intention or the main advantage of the tool, for me, it was a method that allowed me to easily understand the design process.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 11 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/061e01dc-60c0-4619-809c-bad7fcf3c636">

I, too, started creating and connecting nodes one by one in a similar logical manner. As a result, the brep union that had previously failed was successfully completed.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 12 42 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c824b11-3a14-40f0-885e-c7548dfe132c">

I also learned how to fillet and modify edges using Rhino. Ultimately, I was able to create the following model.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 14 16 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06bfe607-6afc-48db-8e43-7f0e438258f5">

3D printing was another challenge. I had to learn how to use a slicer for the 3D printer, set it up properly, and understand the roles of features like brim and infill.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 16 00 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5133f1a9-19d0-4fc5-a9df-e40ffb733601">

At one point, I failed due to incorrect settings, but with some help, I was able to successfully print it as shown here.

<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 16 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d68e4c-519b-41b5-8a64-a69d6ecf24df">
<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 21 07 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b0317c-bc76-4bf6-be4b-f2d1be482d5d">
<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 2 21 15 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53368f65-1b5a-4bcb-a8fc-8453e9217fed">

Working on this project made me realize how challenging it can be, and it gave me a deep sense of appreciation for the everyday items I use. At the same time, I feel like I've developed the ability to understand and reflect on the design process and background of products on my own.

The video project is uploaded at the following link!

## Week of 09/11/2024
First, I tried to understand about the structure of grasshopper. I reviewed the given example and created a diagram.
![grasshopper drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e73c1ec-0a7c-4123-8eef-cb0e11b3cd22)

And I start to make my own. I tried to build my own box.

<img width="1108" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 10 13 01 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a321ce8-f8f0-4b87-b5b8-d19268197a7c">

I found that this node seemed to act as the origin point for the shape I was creating.

<img width="1133" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 10 15 16 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01184f2c-b53e-4e3f-bf81-49f7da8ad668">

So I build a rectangle based on this point and extrude it.

However, the position wasn’t where I wanted it to be. So I put move node with Units. 

<img width="1169" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 11 01 06 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ead1050d-f8ae-4119-9847-82f602be5114">

Now it move to the center.

And then, I tried to brep with the phone from cellphone stand exapmle.

<img width="1275" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 11 44 06 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb6bb18-264e-426d-a49f-4c71ef9d2ba4">

The problem is that the result is just a common line of box and phone.

For better understanding, I follow Youtube video and make box like this.
<img width="1397" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 3 07 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c895c66-0cf2-4404-9448-f5725fdafdd7">

## Week of 09/05/2024

I have experience with 3D printing, but laser cutting is new to me, so I decided to give it a try. I thought it would be nice to highlight the natural color of the wood, so I considered making something like a Welsh Corgi that matches the color.

![5180633_0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a030097-98fe-43a8-bd64-2f8c5481e53d)
<img width="1009" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 11 24 05 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/285499b2-4475-4e5f-84be-bf510d0802b1">

There were specific rules for laser cutting. Lines that needed to be cut were set in red, and areas that needed to be lightly engraved were set in blue, with a line thickness of 0.001. Although the colors can be adjusted depending on the settings, it’s generally recommended to follow the commonly used conventions.

<img width="446" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 11 17 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c554d2b0-0caf-41af-a549-966e729f8578">

After setting the material thickness and other parameters on the laser cutter, I was able to create this cute Corgi!

While waiting for the cutting, I also learned that QR codes can be engraved, which I think could be useful for future projects, so I made a note of it.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

## Week of 09/11/2024
First, I tried to understand about the structure of grasshopper. I reviewed the given example and created a diagram.
![grasshopper drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e73c1ec-0a7c-4123-8eef-cb0e11b3cd22)

And I start to make my own. I tried to build my own box.

I found that this node seemed to act as the origin point for the shape I was creating.

So I build a rectangle based on this point and extrude it.

However, the position wasn’t where I wanted it to be. So I put move node with Units.

Now it move to the center.

And then, I tried to brep with the phone from cellphone stand exapmle.

The problem is that the result is just a common line of box and phone.

For better understanding, I follow Youtube video and make box like this.

## Week of 09/05/2024

I have experience with 3D printing, but laser cutting is new to me, so I decided to give it a try. I thought it would be nice to highlight the natural color of the wood, so I considered making something like a Welsh Corgi that matches the color.

![5180633_0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a030097-98fe-43a8-bd64-2f8c5481e53d)
<img width="1009" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 11 24 05 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/285499b2-4475-4e5f-84be-bf510d0802b1">

There were specific rules for laser cutting. Lines that needed to be cut were set in red, and areas that needed to be lightly engraved were set in blue, with a line thickness of 0.001. Although the colors can be adjusted depending on the settings, it’s generally recommended to follow the commonly used conventions.

<img width="446" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 11 17 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c554d2b0-0caf-41af-a549-966e729f8578">

After setting the material thickness and other parameters on the laser cutter, I was able to create this cute Corgi!

While waiting for the cutting, I also learned that QR codes can be engraved, which I think could be useful for future projects, so I made a note of it.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team

PS: let us know if you have any questions!!
